# Manticore Jailbreak
Manticore Jailbreak is an Free and Open-Source Jailbreak utility developed by the Manticore Team.
Current compatibility: iOS 14.0 -> iOS 14.3 using cicuta_virosa exploit. 

The tool is a work-in-progress. Expect changes.

## About us
The Manticore Jailbreak is an independent jailbreaking tool for all devices, including A14 and below, running iOS 14.3 down to iOS 14.0.
It's our goal to take back the "The most advanced jailbreak" title from unc0ver.
